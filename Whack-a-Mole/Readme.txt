# Whack-a-Mole Game (C++ OpenGL)

This is a simple **Whack-a-Mole** game implemented using **C++** and **OpenGL**. In this game, a mole randomly appears from one of the nine holes on the screen, and the player needs to click on the mole to score points. The mole disappears after a few seconds, and the player’s score is updated accordingly.

## Features

- **Random Mole Generation**: The mole appears at a random hole on the screen.
- **Click to Score**: Players click on the mole to score points.
- **Time Limit**: Each mole remains visible for 2 seconds. If the player does not click the mole in time, they lose points.
- **Score Display**: The player’s score is displayed at the top of the screen.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed to run this game:

- **C++ Compiler**: Any C++11 compatible compiler (GCC, Clang, etc.)
- **OpenGL**: You need OpenGL installed along with the **GLUT** (OpenGL Utility Toolkit) library for window creation and input handling.

### Installing GLUT on Linux

You can install GLUT using the following command on a Linux-based system (Debian/Ubuntu):

```bash
sudo apt-get install freeglut3 freeglut3-dev
```

### Installing GLUT on Windows

1. Download GLUT from [here](https://www.xmission.com/~nate/glut/glut_download.html).
2. Follow the installation steps as per the instructions on the website.

## How to Build and Run

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/whack-a-mole.git
cd whack-a-mole
```

### 2. Compile the Code

To compile the program, use the following command (Linux/macOS):

```bash
g++ -o whack_a_mole whack_a_mole.cpp -lGL -lGLU -lglut
```

For Windows, make sure to link GLUT and OpenGL libraries properly.

### 3. Run the Game

Once compiled, you can run the game with the following command:

```bash
./whack_a_mole
```

## Gameplay

- The game window displays 9 holes, and a mole randomly appears in one of them.
- Click on the mole when it appears to score points.
- The mole disappears after a few seconds if you don't hit it in time, and the score decreases.
- Keep track of your score at the top of the screen.

## How to Play

1. Click on the mole as quickly as possible when it appears.
2. The game continues indefinitely, with the mole appearing at random intervals.
3. Keep an eye on your score at the top of the screen.

### Todo List

- Add sound effects when hitting a mole or missing.
- Implement difficulty levels (e.g., faster mole appearances).
- Improve mole appearance with animations.
- Create a timer for game duration and display a game-over screen.
